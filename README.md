# Webscrapping-and-analyzing-downloaded-data
This is a school project. I extracted public data about final thesis from VSFS university ( https://www.vsfs.cz/ ) and convert them into csv format. Moreover I analyzed extracted data with jupyter notebook.
Python script for webscrapping can be found [here](https://github.com/stepaiv3/Webscrapping-and-analyzing-downloaded-data/blob/master/data/scrappingVSFS01.py).
